- VBA macro that creates PivotTable and Pie Chart

Hello!

This repo contains Schools Data.xlsm which inlcudes a dataset regarding funding from the California Department of Education.

Once opened, you can explore the data and navigate to the Developer tab. There you will see the macro "Bens_Pivot_1"

Running the macro generates a Pivot Table in a one sheet and a 3-D Pie Chart in another sheet.

It's an example of the type of macro I created and used during my time as Director of Finance and Accounting at Minibop Music. 

Being able to analyze such data quickly was crucial to Minibop Music's success when selling educational materials to schools and school districts.
